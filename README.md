# Self-organizing-neural-networks-for-the-analysis-of-country-development
National economies can be influenced in various ways. Our research is focused on post-soviet and Spanish speaking countries. To understand the actual state of the countries and to assess possible trends for their development, we use the SOM-networks. Based on development indicators provided by the World Bank, our approach is shown to explain both major trends as well as changes in the development of the countries. Stable economies are characterized by minor changes and sustained development. Crises, on the other hand, tend to manifest themselves rather by turbulent movements of the economy. In our paper, we demonstrate various types of changes in the states of the country's economy, like financial, economic or moral crises, socio-political turmoils, natural disasters and wars, but also positive events like joining economical organizations or organizing international sports championships. Further, we will provide possible reasons to explain the causes of the found trends and crises.
